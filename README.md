# Gemini-code-generator
This is a Spring Boot app that uses Spring AI, Google Gemini 1.5 Flash and various Google Cloud services to take prompts, generate code, and publish the generated app to Cloud Run.

You can customize and use this without Google Cloud services, and presumably with a different model!

See this [blog post](https://seroter.com/) for a full walkthrough.
